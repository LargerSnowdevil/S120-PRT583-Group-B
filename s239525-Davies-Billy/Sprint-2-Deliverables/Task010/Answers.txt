Understanding the Concept:
The singleton design pattern ensures that there is only ever one instance of a specific class and one global
access point.
Intent:
 Connections made to our database storing information on our customers is spread out and can
 be accessed from many locations. We want to implement a singleton pattern and have one
 global access point.
Problem:
Code all in one location , easier to secure, easier to change later on, don't want multiple connections

Benefits\Motivation to Refactor:
Easier to change later on. More easily maintainable
