Understanding the Concept:
Proxy is a structural design pattern designed to allow you to give access to an object
without allowing direct access to that object. This lets you do some action or check on
whatever the request to that object may be before it reaches the object itself.
This can be helpful for properly securing your software and allowing to have access
to an object without creating it, potentially using less resources.

Intent:
Provide a proxy for a database object so that when a new request comes in that's
when the object is created. Otherwise its always there and consuming resources .


Problem:
Object is always there consuming system resources even when not needed
If the object consumes a lot of resources this can be costly.



Benefits\Motivation to Refactor:
Reduce system resource usage
Provide a way an object can be accessible without being created.
Can delete object when its done being used.
